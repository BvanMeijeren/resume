                        <h3>Data Analyst</h3>
                        <p>Mendix, Rotterdam</p>
                        <p>2018-2024</p>
                        <li><h3>Highlights</h3></li>
                        <li>2018-2019: I started at Mendix as an App Developer. My first project was to build a data wiki app to make colleagues aware of the data and metrics we had, as well as their definitions. The app integrated with major system to pull metadata through APIs, but it also allowed users to enrich that data with things like PII flags (for personal data).</li>
                        <li>2019: After about 6 months of development, I switched roles to ask my manager colleagues about their metrics, so that I could document them in my own app!</li>
                        <li>Late 2019-2021: I switched to the role of Data Analyst and set up new reporting infrastructure for our post-sales team. My biggest challenge here was defining high-level financial metrics in a rapidly changing environment.</li>
                        <li>Late 2021-early 2022: I built a data sync app that served as an intermediary between our CRM system and our datalake, so that some unavailable financials would become available to our sales teams. </li>
                        <li>2022-2023: For about 4 months, I was part of a small team that developed an app that allowed colleagues to check data records for a complex system migration. We scanned old PDF order files using AI computer vision and then displayed the transformed csv data in the app, so that stakeholders could approve (or decline) what the AI detected.</li>
                        <li>2022-2024: I worked with our IT teams and HR team to set up reporting infrastructure there from scratch.</li>
                        <li>Late 2023-2024: I started building pipelines with DBT in between projects to democratize the processed data I used in my reports, making subsequent reports easier to build.</li>
